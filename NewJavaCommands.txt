Here are some I use frequently that aren’t listed, although the refactoring items are available from the refactoring menu shown when you use Alt + Shift + T, but it requires an additional mouse click if you go that route. Refactoring: Alt + Shift + L - Extract highlighted expression to local variable. Alt + Shift + I - Inline highlighted variable (inverse of Alt + Shift + L) Alt + Shift + M - Extract method. Expression Selection (useful in combination with the extract/inline features): Alt + Shift + Up Arrow - Widens current selection to cover the next largest expression either highlighted or where the cursor is located. Alt + Shift + Down Arrow - Narrows current selection to cover the next smallest expression highlighted. Source: Alt + Shift + S - Source menu (provides options for implementing getters/setters, etc). Equivalent to selecting Source from the menu bar, but you don’t have to click, and you can use arrow keys +enter to select an option)
